# Level 1: Static files

Contract version: rust-http-v2. Independent from-scratch task.

## Process API

Submit one UTF-8 main.rs, at most 1 MiB. Build with the pinned rustc in release mode. No Cargo build scripts, proc macros, downloads, subprocess servers, HTTP frameworks or HTTP parser libraries. Rust std and direct libc OS calls through declared FFI are permitted. For Level 5 only, system OpenSSL and zlib FFI are approved. Record unsafe usage in the final report.

Execute `/candidate/server --config /fixtures/server.conf`. Bind within two seconds. Config is UTF-8 key=value, one per line, with optional blank lines and # comments. Unknown keys, duplicate keys, missing keys and malformed values must exit nonzero before listening. All keys below are required. Ports are decimal; limits are positive integers except rate_per_second may be zero. Booleans are true or false. Paths are absolute. root must be an existing directory. Configuration values used by public checks are supplied by the controller.

```ini
listen=127.0.0.1:8080
root=/www
max_connections=8192
header_bytes=8192
header_timeout_ms=1000
idle_timeout_ms=2000
write_timeout_ms=2000
max_requests=100
pipeline_depth=16
```

## Complete wire API

Implement GET over HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 origin-form requests. Respond once and close with Connection: close.
A valid unknown method returns 405. Missing Host is permitted in this restricted profile. Versions other than 1.0 and 1.1 return 400.
Read fragmented requests and require CRLF. Reject bare LF, NUL, invalid header names, folded headers, malformed request lines and malformed headers with 400.
Reject Transfer-Encoding, duplicate Content-Length, invalid lengths and nonzero Content-Length with 400. A single decimal zero, including leading zeroes, is accepted.
Enforce header_bytes including the final CRLFCRLF; excess returns 431. header_timeout_ms is an absolute deadline from accept, even if bytes keep arriving. Close at deadline; 408 is optional.
Strip the query, decode path percent escapes once as UTF-8, reject malformed escapes, fragments, absolute-form, NUL and backslash with 400.
Return 403 for decoded '..' components, symlinks in any component, directories and nonregular files. Missing files return 404. Trailing slash on a regular file returns 403 or 404.
Serve immutable regular files only beneath root. Preserve exact bytes for empty, binary and large files. Explicit Content-Length is mandatory and must match body bytes. No Transfer-Encoding in local responses.
Error bodies may be empty. Successful local responses may use application/octet-stream. Disconnects and malformed clients must not stop later valid service.
Concurrency is optional, but the public benchmark measures service at both 256 and 4096 active clients. Bound every buffer and open descriptor.

## Public acceptance suite

Every listed check is mandatory. The complete executable suite is supplied in public-suite/. The acceptance report names each check. No hidden tests are used. You may implement and run additional tests.

- `bootstrap`: A working server serves an ordinary file, empty file and a missing-file error.
- `files`: Exact ordinary, empty, binary and 2 MiB files; missing file returns 404.
- `query-and-decoding`: Query does not select a different file; strict one-pass percent decoding.
- `confinement`: Traversal and symlinks are forbidden; nonregular objects and trailing file slash are not served.
- `fragmentation`: A request split at each byte remains valid.
- `syntax`: Malformed request/header/version, folded headers and unsupported methods have explicit errors.
- `request-framing`: Local request bodies, ambiguous lengths and transfer coding are rejected; decimal zero is valid.
- `header-limit`: Header section exactly 8192 bytes is accepted; 8193 bytes returns 431.
- `absolute-header-deadline`: Slow fragments cannot extend the one-second absolute header deadline.
- `disconnect-recovery`: Incomplete and abandoned clients do not prevent later valid service.
- `configuration`: Invalid, duplicate, missing and unknown config values exit nonzero before serving.

## Benchmarks

Each workload uses 256 or 4096 active clients, one request outstanding per client, split over four trusted load-generator workers. Five rounds, each with one second of warmup and three seconds of measurement. Per-request deadline is two seconds. Fresh-connection latency includes connect; persistent latency includes reconnect when needed. TLS latency includes handshake when connecting. Failures and timeouts are counted, never retried invisibly. Responses must have the expected status and exact bytes after decompression.

Report valid requests/s, payload bytes/s, p50/p95/p99 successful request latency, failures, timeouts, per-round spread, server CPU and peak RSS, client CPU and event-loop lag. Closed-loop results are conditional on the workload; they are not an open-loop arrival-rate guarantee. Excess generator lag or CPU saturation marks the result inconclusive for optimization. Throughput counts completions inside the measurement window; latency and error totals also include the bounded drain of requests started inside it.

All public checks must pass for full acceptance. A working partial must retain every previously passed check. Optimize throughput without increasing failures, exceeding resource limits, or worsening p99 by more than 5% in any workload. Compare incumbent/challenger in alternating rounds. Require separation of throughput ranges and at least a 5% gain in geometric-mean goodput. If evidence is noisy, keep the incumbent. A partial benchmark never qualifies for promotion.

A build can finish after full acceptance and at least one evaluated optimization attempt, or when time/capacity is exhausted. The controller always exports the best accepted candidate. Report unsupported capabilities explicitly.

## Test suggestions

Start with a runnable file-serving path. Exercise arbitrary TCP fragmentation, path confinement, malformed messages, timeout boundaries, slow senders/readers, disconnect recovery and exact response framing. For applicable features test HEAD body suppression, pipelining order, host separation, proxy retries, cache isolation, TLS, invalid reload and graceful drain. Use small executable increments. Ask budget_status before substantial work. Never weaken required behavior for performance.

## Implementation guidance

Begin with a blocking, bounded request reader and exact file response. Submit that runnable path early. Add strict parsing and confinement before optimizing. Consider bounded workers or nonblocking sockets only after the contract passes. Avoid allocating the whole file per connection; immutable file metadata and sendfile are permitted.

Use the first small fraction of the wall budget to submit a runnable bootstrap. Spend the next work on failed public checks. Once all pass, measure a baseline, make one focused optimization, and compare. These are suggestions, not hidden acceptance rules. Every submission is archived. Failed compiles, lost checks and inconclusive performance leave the incumbent intact. There is no supplied server implementation and no guarantee of success before the first working submission.

The run has 30 minutes by default, independent of the shared dollar cap. A complete paired benchmark needs time proportional to this level’s workload matrix; budget_status reports the remaining time. Finish may skip optimization when a complete comparison no longer fits. Report this as unoptimized or unmeasured, never maximal performance.
